The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) is a leader in large-scale
parallel file system deployment and continuous operation. In the last decade,
the OLCF has designed and deployed two large center-wide parallel file systems.
Spider 1 system served the Jaguar supercomputer and Spider 2 now serves Titan,
among other OLCF computational resources. The OLCF staff has been rigorously
collecting file and storage system statistics from the Spider systems. 

In this paper we present the collected I/O workload statistics from the Spider
2 system and compare it to the Spider 1 data. Our analysis show that Spider 2
is exercised with a more write-heavy I/O workload compared to Spider 1 (75\%
vs. 60\%). Our data also shows that we keeping a healthy space utilization on
Spider 2, due to our periodic purge policies. Furthermore, due to the fixes in
dm\_multipath and ib\_srp software layers, we are utilizing the Spider 2 system
resources more effectively. All our data has been collected by in-house
developed monitoring tools. We believe the observed data set will help us
better design the next-generation Spider file and storage system and will also
be helpful to the larger community for building more effective large-scale file
and storage systems.
