Figure~\ref{fig:spider1-reqsizedist} and Figure~\ref{fig:spider2-reqsizedist} shows
the distribution of read and writes requests on Spider 1
and Spider 2, respectively. The Lustre file system supports a range of request
block sizes, the smallest being 4 kiloBytes (kB) and the largest being 4
MegaBytes (MB).  However, on Spider 1, the smallest block size we were able to
monitor was 16KB, a limitation of the DDN RAID controller. Interpreting from
the CDF and PDF plots here are some interesting observation.

\begin{itemize}

\item  60\% of write requests on Spider 2 where 4kB or less.  In Spider 1, we
unable to distinguish between the 4kB, 8kB and 16kB, which accounted for 50\% of
the write requests.
\item  Also, Spider 2 has 70\% of the requests which are less than or equal to
512kB, whereas on Spider 1, only 55\% of the requests were less than 512kB. ?  
\item   Large number of 512kB requests (SRP ) ?
\item On Spider 2 over 50\% of reads were 1MB, similar to Spider 1 combined
512kB and 1MB were 50\%. However, only 25\% of writes on Spider 2 are 1MB,
whereas on Spider 1 over 45% of writes where either 512kB or 1MB.

\end{itemize}
